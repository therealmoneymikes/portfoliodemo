In next js components in the app folder
are server-side


For client side rendering:

1. use the "use client" at the head of the file
2. Extract only the neccessary aspects that are client side 
   and then import it into the Product Card

a. Fetching on the client is useState + useEffect
b. Resource Intensive 
c. No SEO
d. Less Secure
e. Extra Roundtrip to server


Static rendering
If you pages or components have static data
next js can render it once and then store in it the cache
and render when the application starts

Dynamic Rendering
Is when something is render based on the request time


//In production the timestamp wont change

a circle in the npm run build exec means static data
lamada means server side
